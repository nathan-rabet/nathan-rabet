### Hello, I'm Nathan 👋

🔍 Passionate about the cyber world, I have a keen interest in 

- offensive cybersecurity,
- network systems design & security,
- low-level development,
- creating mobile applications with Flutter.

I take pride in crafting projects that cater to military and governmental applications, believing in the power of technology to transform these sectors.

### My IT Skills 👨‍💻

- **Cybersecurity**: Mostly interested in Red Team subjects (pentest, pwn, APT, malware developement, network attacks), I also enjoy explaining Blue Teams concepts to others.
  - I'm a cybersecurity engineer, which means (I think) I'm not too bad at it.
- **Network Systems**: I enjoy thinking about how to design, implement, and secure network systems.
  - My [CCNA 200-301](https://www.credly.com/badges/b0b57e5a-088f-4563-81ee-5815c8741e9f/public_url) certification kinda helps in that field (I guess).
- **Low-Level Development**: Profound knowledge in languages such as _C_, I also enjoy low _aarch64_ and _x86_/_x86_64_ assembly.
  - Most of my engineering school and research laboratory projects where low-level.
- **Mobile Development**: Experienced in building fullstack Flutter applications for Android and iOS.
  - I built a dating app (which did not really worked)... but that was cool.
